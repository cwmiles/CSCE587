1: For one, large volumes of data are difficult to support because of the amount of memory/ storage space
needed. In addition, RDBMS are best at taking in a steady flow of data, but its harder to grow the data. Also, 
sorting the data can be particularly difficult depending on what is collected.

2: NoSQL databases have grown increasingly popular despite it not supporting ACID properties due to the fact 
NoSQL databases can scale out very quickly, can handle high traffic, and allow more customized database.

Using the Hive database that you built during the Hive lab lecture, write the queries to compute the followings.  
Return the answers as csv files for each query:

a.Query 1: return the name, location, and the wageplan of the driver with driver Id 10
b.Query 2: return the Id of the drivers who logged more than 70 hours at any week.
(Note: use SELECT DISTINCT instead of SELECT to eliminate duplicate occurrences of the same driverId.)
c.Query 3: return the driver’s Id and name of each driver and the driver’s miles per hours ratio.  

3a: select name, location, wageplan from drivers where driverid = 10;

3b: select distinct driverid from timesheet where hours_logged > 70; 

3c: select d.driverid, d.name, t.mph from drivers d
	join (select driverid, ceiling(sum(miles_logged)/sum(hours_logged)) mph from timesheet Group by driverid) t
	on (d.driverid=t.driverid);
