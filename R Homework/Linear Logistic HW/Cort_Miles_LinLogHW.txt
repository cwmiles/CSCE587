1a) plot(gold_target1$V1~gold_target1$V2)

1b) r = lm(gold_target1$V1~gold_target1$V2)
    str(r)

1c) par(mfrow=c(2,2))
    plot(r)

e. Do the residuals have the property of homoscedasticity? Explain!

1d) This tells us that the beggining values where residuals are between -5 and 5 there is  
    a good fit, however there are some 'outliers' that have a high variance (being far 
    away from the red line) which shows that the fit isnt perfect and probably could be 
    better.

1e) No the the residuals do not have the property of homoscedasticity because the variance 
    isnt the same (or even similar) for all the points as there are significant outliers 
    such as #58, #63, #64 in the top left graph. If the fit line was more accurate and 
    there was a solid trend where the variance across the data was more similar then it 
    would have the property of homoscedasticity.

1f) ypred = predict(r)
    par(mfrow=c(1,1))
    plot(gold_target1$V1,gold_target1$V1,type='l',xlab="observed y",ylab="predicted y")
    points(gold_target1$V1,ypred)

2a) plot(gold_target1$V4~gold_target1$V1)

2b) plot(gold_target1$V4~gold_target1$V2)

2c) glm.out = glm(V4~V2, family=binomial(logit), data=gold_target1)

2d) plot(gold_target1$V4~gold_target1$V2)
    lines(gold_target1$V2,glm.out$fitted,type="l", col="red")
    ### NOTE - I had to change lrm1 to glm.out as lrm1 wasnt recognized

2e) glm.out = glm(V4~V1+V2, family=binomial(logit), data=gold_target1)

2f) summary(glm.out) 
    ###NOTE - Need to write glm.out again and then summary(glm.out) for part 2c as well
    The estimate coefficient of gold_target$V2 in step 2c is 1.7606 with a z-val of 3.606 and significance code of *** which is 0.001  
    The estimate coefficient of gold_target$V2 in step 2e is 0.9235 with a z-val of 2.059 and significance code of *** which is 0.05
    In these two the confidence went up in 2e, which means the relationship doesnt have to be as strong to still be 'confident' in the value. 

3) (1/4)/(1-1/4) = (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3 = 0.333333
